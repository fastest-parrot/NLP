       "2  I have to say to make such an impressive trailer and such an uninteresting film, takes some doing.Here you have most of the elements that would make a very good film. You have great special effects, a sci-fi conundrum, beautiful visuals and good sound. Yet the most important part of the film is missing. There is no plot, character or soul to this film. It's like having a beautiful building on the outside with no paint or decoration on the inside.It's an empty shell of a film. There is no ten...   \n",

Yet, it still stunned my mind, kept me enjoyed its every moment and left me with many thoughts afterward.\\nFor someone like me, who've rarely slept without dream, it's so exciting watching how Christopher Nolan had illustrated every single characteristic of dream on the big screen. As it's been done so sophisticatedly, I do believe the rumour that Nolan had spent 10 years to finish the script of Inception. In my opinion, it's been so far the greatest achievem...   \n",
       "4  I find it somewhat odd that some people have interpreted this film as anticapitalist. It shines a very narrow light on poverty but it is all conveyed in a very surreal scenario which makes it quite difficult to emotionally engage with the situations that transpire. However, that's not the only reason.The main characters are not particularly likeable, which I'm sure defenders of the film would describe them as morally grey, given the prevailing cultural obsession with the moral ambiguity.It's...   \n",

    "***From a cursory examination of the clusters generated when allowing the algorithm to use 20 centroids, we can see that the differentiation of each cluster really starts to take form. Most clusters have review sentiment vocabulary (like, best, 10 etc) and some tilt towards a particular genre, director or actor. This is much better than our choice of using 5 (the default) or 3 (a lower number than the default). Further tuning could be done to see where the tradeoff between accuracy / generalization lies as far as the choice for the parameter k. Choosing a value too high could lead to clusters that are far too specific for the intended use.***"
